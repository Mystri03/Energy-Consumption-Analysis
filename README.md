# Energy Consumption Analysis

Household Power Consumption Forecasting & KPI Dashboard
This project analyzed and predicted household electricity usage using historical data. Starting from a raw text file, I cleaned and transformed the data, then explored trends and patterns with Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

I built and compared several machine learning and time series models—like Linear Regression and SARIMA—to forecast future power consumption, measuring their performance with RMSE and MAPE. Key insights included identifying peak usage times and seasonal trends.

Results are presented in an interactive Power BI dashboard, making it easy to track KPIs, spot high-usage periods, and uncover ways to use energy more efficiently. Overall, the project combines hands-on data science with practical insights for smarter, more sustainable electricity use.
